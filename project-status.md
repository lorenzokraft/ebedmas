## Answer Submission Fix (2025-01-05)

### Issue
The answer submission system was failing due to a mismatch between frontend and backend data formats. The frontend was sending option IDs while the backend expected answer text.

### Changes Made

#### Frontend (`TopicQuizPage.tsx`)
1. Answer Processing
   - Added conversion from option ID to answer text before submission
   - Updated drag-and-drop answer formatting
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. API Integration
   - Changed submit endpoint from `/questions/submit` to `/questions/answer`
   - Improved error handling and logging
   - Added validation for different question types

#### Backend (`questionController.ts`)
1. Answer Validation
   - Simplified answer checking to compare actual text values
   - Added case-insensitive comparison
   - Implemented consistent array comparison for drag answers
   - Added detailed logging at each step

2. Route Updates (`questions.ts`)
   - Updated endpoint from `/submit` to `/answer`
   - Maintained consistent API structure

### Testing Status
- ✅ Click-type questions working
- ✅ Text-type questions working
- ✅ Drag-and-drop questions working
- ✅ Answer feedback displaying correctly
- ✅ Explanation images showing in modal

### Next Steps
1. Add unit tests for answer validation
2. Implement error recovery for failed submissions
3. Add answer submission analytics
4. Consider caching question data for better performance

## Next Steps
1. Test all quiz types thoroughly (text, click, drag)
2. Add audio playback functionality
3. Implement remaining user features
4. Add more analytics features

## Known Issues
- None at the moment
